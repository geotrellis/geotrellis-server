# GeoTrellis OGC Services

This is a scala project that is able to serve contents of Geotrellis
indexed layers and transformations of said layers which can be described
with the help of the
[Map Algebra Modeling Language (MAML)](https://github.com/geotrellis/maml)
in accordance with certain OGC standards. The currently supported standards
are [Web Coverage Service](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs),
[Web Map Service](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms),
and [Web Map Tile Service](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts).

Each layer presented by a given service requires that appropriate
configuration be provided *at the start of the application*. To get
started with a demonstration configuration and demonstration layers,
check out [usage.md](./usage.md). Once comfortable with starting the
server and interacting with the resources it provides, modification
of the configuration to serve your own layers is a logical next step
and is documented in [conf.md](./conf.md). If the evaluation
of complex layers with MAML requires special tuning, look to
[maml.md](./maml.md) for an explanation of how MAML ASTs (which are
used directly in the configuration file to support complex, map algebra
layers) are interpreted.
